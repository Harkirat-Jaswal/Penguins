Like as the waves make towards the pebbl'd shore,
<p align="center">
So do our minutes hasten to their end;
<p align="center">
Each changing place with that which goes before,
<p align="center">
In sequent toil all forwards do contend.

Nativity, once in the main of light,
<p align="center">
Crawls to maturity, wherewith being crown'd,
<p align="center">
Crooked eclipses 'gainst his glory fight,
<p align="center">
And Time that gave doth now his gift confound.

<p align="center">
Time doth transfix the flourish set on youth
<p align="center">
And delves the parallels in beauty's brow,
<p align="center">
Feeds on the rarities of nature's truth,
<p align="center">
And nothing stands but for his scythe to mow:

And yet to times in hope my verse shall stand,
<p align="center">
Praising thy worth, despite his cruel hand.
