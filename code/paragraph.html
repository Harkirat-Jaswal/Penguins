What Is a Computer? 
</h2>


<Body>

	A computer is an electronic device that takes in an input of data and processes it, resulting in an output of information. A computer can also store data in its memory and recall/use them when required. Computers consist of hardware and software. Hardware are the physical parts of a computer that you can touch, some examples are a CPU, a GPU, a Mother board, etc. Software are digital programs and information such as system software.

Primary and Secondary memory
</h2>


	There are two types of primary memory,
<U>
Random Access Memory (RAM)
</U>
, and 
<U>
Read Only memory (ROM)
</U>
. RAM is temporally stored memory that is accessed by the processer when needed and will be deleted when power supply is removed. ROM is permanent memory that will remain even when power supply is removed and cannot be modified. Secondary memory is like ROM but can be modified and is stored on external devices such as a hard drive, DVD or optical disk. Diffrent Tasks require diffrent types of memory.

​​Computer Viruses
</h2>


	There are three
<I>
common
</i>
<U>
viruses
</U>
,
<U>
email viruses
</U>
,
<U>
trojan hourse
</U>
,and
<U>
worms
</U>
.
 Viruses are small piece of software that goes with real programs. Email viruses travel as an attachment to email messages, and replicates by mailing itself to other users and sometimes launch when you view the message in the preview pane. Trojan horses a virus that claims to be something else like a gaming software. Worms are small software that find computer networks and security holes to replicate itself and then sends that copy to find a security hole in a computer and starts replicating within it.

Input and Output Devices
</h2>

<Body>

Input devices are a part of hardware that input information such as keyboards, microphones, webcams, etc. An output device is any part of a computer hardware used to communicate information/data as an output that is human readable. Output is formed when a computer proccesses a given input. A CPU in the part of the computer that processes most of the information/data inputted in the computer and converting it into an output.

Charaestics of a Computer and Data, Information and Knowledge
</h2>

<Body>

Speed, accuracy, diligance, storage, amd versatility. Computers process data extremely fast​, provide high accuracy, cannot bcome fatigued or tired, can store large amount of data and informationand can be realesed when needed, and can operate many tasks and applications. Data are facts and figures which relay something specific but are not organized in any way. For data to become information, it must be categorized, calculated, and condensed, leading it to be understood.​ Knowledge being the understanding of an event or data presented​.
