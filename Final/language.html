                The Hittites spoke an Indo-European language known as Hittite, which was written using the cuneiform script. Hittite is the oldest recorded Indo-European language, with written records dating back to around 1650 BC.

                <br>
                The Hittite language was part of the Anatolian branch of the Indo-European language family, which also includes the extinct languages Luwian, Palaic, and Hieroglyphic Luwian. Hittite was spoken in central Anatolia (modern-day Turkey) and was the official language of the Hittite Empire.

                Hittite texts were written on clay tablets using cuneiform script, which was originally developed for writing the Sumerian and Akkadian languages in Mesopotamia. The Hittites adapted the cuneiform script to write their own language, making modifications to represent the unique sounds and grammar of Hittite.

                The Hittite language had a complex grammar, with a highly inflected system of nouns and verbs. It also had a unique feature called "consonant gradation," where certain consonants alternated between different forms based on the grammatical context.

                <br>
                The Hittite language was used for a wide range of purposes, including legal texts, religious rituals, historical records, and diplomatic correspondence. The Hittites also produced literary works, such as myths and legends, which provide valuable insights into their culture and beliefs.
                <br>
                <br>
                After the fall of the Hittite Empire around 1180 BC, the Hittite language gradually fell out of use and was eventually replaced by other languages in the region, such as Luwian and Aramaic. However, the discovery and decipherment of Hittite texts in the late 19th and early 20th centuries have shed light on this ancient language and its significance in the history of Indo-European linguistics.
