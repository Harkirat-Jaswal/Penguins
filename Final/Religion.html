                    The Hittites had a polytheistic religion, worshipping a pantheon of gods and goddesses. Some of the major deities in their religion included:
                    <ul>
                      <li>Teshub: The storm god, who was one of the most important deities in the Hittite pantheon. He was associated with thunder, lightning, and rain.</li>
                      <li>Arinna: The sun goddess, who was the chief goddess and the consort of Teshub.</li>
                      <li>Kamrusepas: The god of war and protection.</li>
                      <li>Hepat: The goddess of fertility and grain.</li>
                      <li>Shaushka: The god of the sun and war.</li>
                    </ul>
                    </ul>
                <br>
                <br>
                The Hittites also incorporated deities and religious practices from other cultures they encountered, such as the Hurrian and Mesopotamian civilizations. They had a complex system of rituals, festivals, and sacrifices to honor their gods.

                The religious practices of the Hittites were closely tied to the state and the ruling class. The king played a significant role in religious ceremonies and was considered to have a special relationship with the gods.

                The Hittites built temples and sanctuaries for their deities, and many of their religious practices revolved around these sacred spaces. They also had a class of priests and priestesses who performed rituals and maintained the religious traditions.
                <br>
                <br>
                Overall, the Hittite religion was an integral part of their culture and played a significant role in their society, influencing various aspects of their daily life and governance.
