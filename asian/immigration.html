Several thousand came from the coastal areas of the United States where they had helped to build the American transcontinental railroad, but the majority arrived directly from southern China. The province of British Columbia already had a sizeable Chinese population, and racism towards the Chinese community was widespread. The media of the time often portrayed Chinese cultural practices such as clothing styles, living conditions, and even funeral rites, in a degrading way.";

                    document.getElementById("events").innerText="Through the Chinese Immigration Act of 1885, a $50 head tax was imposed on every Chinese person seeking entry into Canada, marking a period of legislated anti-Chinese racism. The head tax followed the building and completion of the Canadian Pacific Railway (1881-85), which brought Chinese workers to Canada. These workers were needed as a labour force but not deemed desirable as citizens because of their country of origin. The head tax was raised to $100 in 1900 and to $500 in 1903 in further attempts to make immigration prohibitive for Chinese individuals. Additionally, the Electoral Franchise Act of 1885 disenfranchised all immigrants of Chinese origin, making them ineligible to vote in federal elections.Despite the head tax, Chinese immigrants continued to settle in Canada. On July 1, 1923, Dominion Day, Parliament passed the Chinese Immigration Act. The Act is commonly referred to as the Chinese Exclusion Act, because it largely restricted all Chinese immigration to Canada by narrowly defining the acceptable categories of Chinese immigrants and prevented many residents from reuniting with their families. Since the Act was passed on Dominion Day, the Chinese Canadian community called it Humiliation Day, as this Act was perceived as the ultimate form of humiliation. The Chinese Immigration Act of 1923 was repealed in 1947. During the years the Act was in force, fewer than 50 Chinese immigrants were allowed to come to Canada.";

                    document.getElementById("events").innerText="In 1963, Canada formally established diplomatic relations with South Korea, but until the Canadian embassy in South Korea opened in 1973, most Koreans who came to Canada continued to do so on a temporary basis, for education and work opportunities. After 1973, the first significant wave of permanent Korean immigrants came to Canada. Over 26,000 immigrants arrived in a decade, which formed the basis of the Korean community in Canada today. Since then, immigration numbers have shifted based on social, economic, and political conditions in each country, ranging from 1,000 immigrants to nearly 10,000 each year. Most Korean immigrants arriving in Canada on a permanent basis were skilled workers or professionals and settled in urban centres such as Toronto, Vancouver, Montreal, Edmonton, and Calgary. The 2021 Census recorded 217,650 people of Korean origin in Canada.";
