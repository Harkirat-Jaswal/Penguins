        The Solar System is about 4.568 billion years old.
         The Sun was formed by gravity pulling in many molecules.
          It is mainly made of hydrogen, which it converts into helium through nuclear fusion.
           The planets are in a orbiting disk.
            This disk was partly left over from the cloud that formed the Sun, plus other material as the Sun moved through space.
             Eventually, the gas and dust of the disk came together into planets.
              It is thought that almost all stars and their planets form this way.
